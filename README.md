# 8-Puzzle

## Objective 
The 8-puzzle is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square (-1) with the goal to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order.
The purpose of this program is to return a series of states (path) from the initial to the goal configuration, an the number of generated nodes (states), given an initial configuration and a goal configuration.
The puzzle will be ordered using depth first search, breadth first search, and best first search with the following heuristics: depth in the search space + number of tiles out of place, depth in the search space + minimum number of moves to reach the goal state and depth in the search space + the heuristic H defined below.

## Equipment 
Computer running Windows, MacOS or Linux, with an Intel or AMD based processor (x86 or x86-64). VS Code, and a browser such as FireFox or Chrome, is recommended.
